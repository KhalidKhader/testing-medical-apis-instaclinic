Good morning, missus Smith. It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit? Good morning, doctor. Well, I've been feeling a little better. The racing heart doesn't happen as often. That's good to hear. Are you still feeling dizzy and weak? Not as much as before, but I do still get winded quite easily. I see. Have you been taking the Metoprol as prescribed? Yes, doctor. I take it every day. Any side effects from the medication? I've been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but nothing too serious. Very well. We'll keep an eye on that. Now let's take a look at your test results. Your egg shows that your heart rate has slowed down, which is a good sign. Your echocardiogram also shows improvement in the pumping function of your heart. That's relieving to hear, doctor. It is indeed. In light of these results, I think we should continue with your current medication plan. Remember to keep reducing your caffeine and alcohol consumption as well. Alright, doctor. I'll do my best.
