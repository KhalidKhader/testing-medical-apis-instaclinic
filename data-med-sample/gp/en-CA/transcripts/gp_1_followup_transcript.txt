Good morning, missus Johnson. How have you been feeling since our last visit? Good morning, doctor. I've noticed some improvement, but I still feel quite tired. Have you been taking your levothyroxine and metformin as prescribed? Yes. I have been taking them daily. Have you noticed any change in your weight, mood, skin, or hair? My mood has improved slightly, but I haven't noticed any significant changes in my weight or the condition of my skin and hair. Any side effects from the medications? No. I haven't noticed any side effects. That's good to hear. Let's do a physical examination. Doctor performs physical examination. Your vitals are stable and the puffiness around your eyes has reduced. However, your skin remains dry. Let's review your blood test results. Doctor reviews blood test results. Your chills have decreased but are still above the normal range, indicating that your hypothyroidism is not yet fully controlled. We need to slightly increase your levothyroxine dosage. Okay, doctor. Continue with your balanced diet and regular exercise and take the increased dosage of levothyroxine. Will do, doctor. I understand, doctor. Thank you.
