## Subjective: 
The patient reports significant improvement in symptoms since starting the prescribed dose of Nitrofurantoin. The patient no longer experiences pain during urination, frequent urination, fever, or abdominal pain. Patient has been adhering to the medication regimen as instructed and reports no noticeable side effects. The patient has expressed relief and satisfaction with the improvement but queries whether the infection has been fully cleared.

## Objective: 
Physical examination reveals stable vitals and the patient's lower abdomen is no longer tender. The lab results confirm a diagnosis of a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the reported symptoms have improved, indicating that the antibiotics are effectively managing the infection.

## Assessment: 
The patient had a UTI, as confirmed by lab results. The current course of antibiotics (Nitrofurantoin) seems to be effective in treating the infection, as indicated by the patient's reported reduction in symptoms and the physical examination findings.

## Plan: 
Patient is advised to continue the full course of Nitrofurantoin to ensure complete clearance of the UTI. Patient is also advised to maintain hydration and avoid bladder irritants such as coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods.
