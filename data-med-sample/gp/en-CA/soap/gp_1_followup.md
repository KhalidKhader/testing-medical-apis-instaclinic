# SOAP Note

## Subjective:
70-year-old female, diagnosed with a urinary tract infection (UTI) at the previous visit, reports significant improvement in symptoms - decreased frequency and discomfort during urination, no fever, and no abdominal pain. She has been adhering to the prescribed medication regimen without any reported side effects.
## Objective:
Vital signs within normal limits. No abdominal tenderness noted upon examination. Lab results confirm UTI, but based on the patient's symptom resolution, it appears to be responding well to the treatment.
## Assessment:
UTI - improving significantly with the antibiotic treatment.
## Plan:
Advise patient to continue Nitrofurantoin 100mg twice daily for the remaining course. Encourage patient to continue hydration and avoidance of bladder irritants. Schedule a follow-up in two weeks to ensure complete resolution of the infection.
