Good morning, miss Johnson. How have you been since your last visit? Good morning, doctor. I've been feeling quite tired and have been gaining weight despite eating and exercising normally. I'm sorry to hear that. Has there been any other changes like in your mood, skin, or hair? Yes. I have been feeling a bit low, and my hair has become dry and thin. Have you been taking your levothyroxine as prescribed? Yes. I have been taking it daily. It's important that we monitor your symptoms closely because they may be related to your hypothyroidism. We might need to adjust your medication dosage. Let's do a physical examination. Doctor performs physical examination. Your vital signs are normal, but I noticed some puffiness around your eyes and dryness in your skin. I am going to order some blood tests to check your thyroid hormone levels. Okay, doctor. We might need to adjust your levothyroxine dosage based on your test results. It is also important to have a balanced diet and regular exercise. Okay. I understand. With you, doctor.
