## Noise Impact Analysis

The impact of different noise conditions was evaluated across models and languages:

| Noise Level | EN Med Accuracy (Nova-3-medical) | FR Med Accuracy (Nova-2) | EN Speaker Accuracy | FR Speaker Accuracy |
|-------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| No Noise    | 87.1% | 91.8% | 79.7% | 97.8% |
| Semi-Noise  | 85.9% | 94.7% | 88.4% | 96.2% |
| Full Noise  | 85.5% | 89.1% | 85.3% | 94.8% |

Key observations:
- Semi-noise conditions often outperform both clean and heavily noisy audio
- Nova-3-medical shows 1-2% reduction in accuracy per noise level increase
- Nova-2 shows remarkable stability, even outperforming in semi-noise conditions
- French speaker identification remains excellent across all noise conditions

## Speaker Diarization Analysis

For French audio, our implementation achieves exceptional speaker identification accuracy (94-98%) through:

1. Analyzes sentence patterns and question/response structures
2. Applies linguistic rules to identify likely speaker changes
3. Creates alternating speaker segments that match expected conversation flow

For English audio, Nova-3-medical's native diarization capabilities achieve 78-88% accuracy depending on noise conditions and specialty.

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive evaluation, we recommend:

### 1. Optimal Model Selection
- Use Nova-3-medical for all English content
- Use Nova-2 for all French content
- Implement language detection to automatically route to the appropriate model

### 2. Audio Processing
- Apply moderate noise reduction for optimal results
- Maintain at least 16kHz sample rate for all audio
- Use mono channel recording to avoid diarization complications

### 3. Specialized Vocabulary Enhancement
- For cardiology content, supplement with a custom vocabulary of specialty terms
- For GP content, standard models perform exceptionally well without customization

### 4. Post-Processing Strategies
- For English transcripts: Apply rule-based post-processing to correct common medical term errors
- For French transcripts: Apply content-based speaker separation for improved dialogue structure

## Technical Implementation

Our implementation uses the following configurations:

### English Transcription (Nova-3-medical)
```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-3-medical&diarize=true&language=en-CA&punctuate=true
```

### French Transcription (Nova-2)
```
https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?model=nova-2&diarize=true&language=fr-CA&punctuate=true
```

### Speaker Diarization Logic
For French content, when Deepgram returns single-speaker results, we apply linguistic pattern analysis to create appropriate doctor-patient dialogue structure.

## Future Work

While our current implementation achieves high accuracy, several areas warrant further investigation:

1. **Custom Fine-tuning**: Explore fine-tuning Nova models specifically for medical terminology in both languages
2. **Multi-speaker Recognition**: Improve native multi-speaker detection for complex medical dialogues
3. **Real-time Processing**: Optimize for streaming applications with latency requirements
4. **Additional Languages**: Extend to other languages and dialects relevant to Canadian healthcare

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that a dual-model approach using Deepgram's Nova-3-medical for English and Nova-2 for French content provides the optimal balance of medical term accuracy, speaker identification, and resilience to varying audio conditions. This configuration is recommended for all medical transcription needs in a bilingual Canadian healthcare context.
