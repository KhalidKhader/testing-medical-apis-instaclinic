# SOAP Note

## Subjective:
The patient reports feeling tired, but states the chest discomfort has lessened in intensity during exertion. The patient has been compliant with the medication regimen which includes Azole, a beta blocker, and a statin. The patient reports occasional dizziness after taking the beta blocker. No other side effects were reported.

## Objective:
Patient's heart rate and blood pressure show improvement but are still slightly elevated. Recent tests, including an EKG and echocardiogram, show some damage from a heart attack. Stress test results are encouraging.

## Assessment:
Patient's symptoms, along with the EKG and echocardiogram results, indicate a previous heart attack. The patient's tiredness and occasional dizziness may be side effects of the medications. The chest discomfort during exertion is a typical symptom of coronary artery disease, but the patient reports it is less intense than before.

## Plan:
Continuation of the current treatment plan as it appears to be effective. The patient is advised to stand up slowly and sit down if feeling dizzy after taking the beta blocker. If dizziness continues or worsens, the dosage may need to be adjusted. Regular monitoring of symptoms and adjustments to treatment as needed.
