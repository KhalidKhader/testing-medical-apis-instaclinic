**SUBJECTIVE:**
The patient reports mild improvement in symptoms since the last visit. Specifically, the patient notes a decrease in sneezing and runny nose but no change in itchy and watery eyes. The patient has been consistently using the prescribed antihistamines, nasal spray, and eye drops. No side effects from the medications have been reported. The patient seems willing to consider getting a flu shot.

**OBJECTIVE:**
Upon physical examination, the patient's nasal passage appears less swollen, suggesting a positive response to the treatment. No other physical abnormalities were noted.

**ASSESSMENT:**
The patient appears to be experiencing allergic rhinitis, with predominant ocular symptoms persisting. There is no indication of medication side effects or other medical conditions. The patient's improvement in nasal symptoms suggests effective treatment, but the persistent eye symptoms may require a different approach. 

**PLAN:**
Recommended a stronger allergy eye drop for the patient's persistent itchy and watery eyes. Continue with the current antihistamines and nasal spray. The flu shot was suggested to the patient as a preventive measure for the upcoming flu season.
