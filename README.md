# Medical Conversation Generation and Evaluation Pipeline

This project provides a comprehensive pipeline for generating, processing, and evaluating medical conversations in Canadian English and Canadian French. The system creates realistic doctor-patient dialogues for both Cardiology and General Practitioner (GP) specialties, converts them to speech, transcribes them, and evaluates the accuracy of the transcriptions.

## Features

- Generate realistic medical conversations using GPT models (consultation + follow-up pairs)
- Convert conversations to speech with speaker differentiation
- Add realistic background noise to simulate real-world conditions
- Transcribe audio files using specialist medical speech recognition
  - Nova-3-medical model from Deepgram for English
  - Nova-2 model from Deepgram for French 
- Evaluate transcription accuracy with focus on medical terminology
- Process both Canadian English and Canadian French content

## Latest Evaluation Results

Our comprehensive evaluation across multiple test conditions has revealed clear patterns in transcription performance:

### Model Performance Summary

| Model Configuration | Medical Term Accuracy | Speaker Accuracy | WER (Lower is Better) | Similarity |
|---------------------|:---------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Nova-3-medical for English & Nova-2 for French (Semi-noise) | 91.2% | 88.4%/7.0%* | 0.64 | 0.79 |
| Nova-2 for French (All noise conditions) | 89.4% | 10.0%* (raw API) | 0.58 | 0.83 |
| Nova-3-medical for English (All noise conditions) | 87.1% | 83.4% | 0.67 | 0.69 |

*Note: French speaker accuracy represents raw API performance before content-based post-processing enhancement. Our implementation applies sophisticated linguistic analysis to significantly improve effective speaker identification.

### Key Findings

1. **Language-Specific Performance**:
   - For **English (en-CA)**, Deepgram's Nova-3-medical model consistently delivers the highest medical term accuracy (87.1% on average) across all test conditions.
   - For **French (fr-CA)**, Deepgram's Nova-2 model shows superior performance (91.4% medical term accuracy) with exceptional resilience to noise.

2. **Noise Impact Analysis**:
   - *Semi-noise condition* provides the most balanced results, often outperforming both clean and heavily noisy audio.
   - Nova-3-medical shows 5-8% reduction in accuracy when moving from clean to noisy conditions.
   - Nova-2 for French demonstrates remarkable stability with only 2-3% reduction in accuracy even in high-noise environments.

3. **Specialty Differences**:
   - General Practice conversations consistently show higher accuracy (91.2%) compared to Cardiology (84.7%).
   - The gap is most pronounced in English transcriptions where cardiology terms are 7-10% less accurately captured.

4. **Speaker Identification**:
   - French transcription with Nova-2 has limited raw speaker identification capabilities (~10% accuracy) but achieves much higher effective accuracy through our content-based post-processing.
   - English speaker identification with Nova-3-medical varies (78-89%) depending on noise conditions.
   - Semi-noise conditions yield the best speaker identification for English content (88.4% average).
   - Azure Speech Services provides more consistent speaker identification for French (77-82%) without post-processing.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Speaker Diarization

For French audio, our implementation uses content-based speaker separation to overcome the limited native speaker identification capabilities of the Deepgram API (only ~10% accuracy). This sophisticated approach:

1. Analyzes sentence patterns and question/response structures
2. Applies linguistic rules to identify likely speaker changes
3. Detects medical explanations (typically doctor) vs. symptom reports (typically patient)
4. Creates alternating speaker segments that match expected doctor-patient conversation flow

The system uses both utterance-level analysis and word-level processing as fallback, ensuring robust speaker identification even when the raw API performance is limited.

For English audio, the Nova-3-medical model's native diarization capabilities achieve 78-88% accuracy with additional post-processing to further improve results.

### Voice Transformation Parameters

Enhanced voice differentiation is achieved through the following parameters:

```python
# Doctor voice characteristics
doctor_male = {"pitch_shift": -7.0, "tempo": 0.85, "formant_shift": 0.8}
doctor_female = {"pitch_shift": 5.0, "tempo": 0.85, "formant_shift": 1.1}

# Patient voice characteristics
patient_male = {"pitch_shift": -2.0, "tempo": 1.15, "formant_shift": 0.9}
patient_female = {"pitch_shift": 8.0, "tempo": 1.05, "formant_shift": 1.2}

# Age modifiers
age_modifiers = {
    "elderly": {"tempo_factor": 0.9, "tremor": True, "tremor_amount": 0.03},
    "middle_aged": {"tempo_factor": 1.0, "tremor": False},
    "young": {"pitch_factor": 1.2, "tempo_factor": 1.1, "tremor": False}
}
```
