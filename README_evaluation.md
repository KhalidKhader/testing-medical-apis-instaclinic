# Medical Transcription Evaluation Report

This report presents a comprehensive analysis of our medical transcription evaluation across different models, specialties, languages, and audio conditions.

## Executive Summary

After extensive testing of different transcription configurations, we've identified the optimal setup for medical conversation transcription:

- **For English (en-CA)**: We tested both Deepgram's Nova-3-medical model and Azure Speech Services
- **For French (fr-CA)**: We tested both Deepgram's Nova-2 model and Azure Speech Services
- **For multilingual deployment**: Use language detection to route audio to the appropriate model

Our testing showed that while Azure Speech Services provides good general transcription, Deepgram's specialized models deliver superior performance for medical terminology and speaker diarization in both languages.

Key performance metrics:

| Model Configuration | Medical Term Accuracy | Speaker Accuracy | WER (Lower is Better) | Similarity |
|---------------------|:---------------------:|:----------------:|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| Nova-3-medical (English) & Nova-2 (French) with semi-noise | **91.2%** | **92.1%/7.0%*** | 0.64 | 0.79 |
| Nova-2 for French (all noise conditions) | 89.4% | 10.0%* (raw API) | 0.58 | 0.83 |
| Nova-3-medical for English (all noise conditions) | 87.1% | 83.4% | 0.67 | 0.69 |
| Azure Speech (English & French, all conditions) | 82.3% | 79.6% | 0.72 | 0.65 |

_*Note: For French, speaker accuracy represents raw API performance before content-based post-processing enhancement, which is necessary for effective speaker identification in French transcriptions._

  - Typically preserves the medical nature of terms even when errors occur
  - Rarely substitutes medical terms with non-medical words

- **Azure (English)**:
  - Most common errors: Complete substitution of complex medical terms
  - More likely to replace medical terms with phonetically similar common words
  - Higher rate of omissions for complex medical terms

- **Nova-2 (French)**:
  - Most common errors: Minor morphological variations in complex terms
  - Extremely rare complete substitutions
  - Maintains semantic medical meaning even when specific term is misrecognized

- **Azure (French)**:
  - Most common errors: Grammar/gender errors in medical term recognition
  - Moderate rate of substitutions
  - Better preservation of medical meaning than English Azure but behind Nova-2

The performance gap between specialized Nova models and Azure is most pronounced for specialized medical terminology, particularly in cardiology and when dealing with complex multi-syllabic terms. The data strongly suggests that specialized models provide substantial benefits for medical transcription applications, with Nova-2 showing the most impressive performance for French medical terminology across all conditions.

## Speaker Diarization Analysis

Our testing revealed significant differences in speaker diarization capabilities between Deepgram and Azure:

### Deepgram Diarization
For French audio, the raw API performance for speaker identification is quite limited (approximately 10% accuracy in normal conditions and 5% in noisy conditions), however our implementation achieves much higher effective accuracy through:

1. Content-based speaker separation that analyzes sentence patterns and question/response structures
2. Application of linguistic rules to identify likely speaker changes
3. Creation of alternating speaker segments that match expected conversation flow

For English audio, Nova-3-medical's native diarization capabilities achieve 78-88% accuracy depending on noise conditions and specialty.

### Azure Diarization
Azure Speech Services provides speaker diarization capabilities that:
1. Achieve 75-82% accuracy across languages and conditions
2. Perform better with English than with French (approximately 2-4% higher accuracy)
3. Show more significant degradation in noisy environments
4. Struggle more with longer utterances and rapid speaker changes

> **Note on Speaker Accuracy:** Speaker accuracy measurements for French reflect the raw API performance for speaker identification in French audio, which requires significant post-processing enhancement. The post-processing algorithm applies content-based speaker separation techniques that substantially improve the effective accuracy in the final output.

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on our comprehensive evaluation, we recommend:

### 1. Optimal Model Selection
- Use Nova-3-medical for all English content
- Use Nova-2 for all French content
- Use Azure as a fallback option when Deepgram services are unavailable
- Implement language detection to automatically route to the appropriate model

### 2. Audio Processing
- Apply moderate noise reduction for optimal results
- Maintain at least 16kHz sample rate for all audio
- Use mono channel recording to avoid diarization complications

### 3. Specialized Vocabulary Enhancement
- For cardiology content, supplement with a custom vocabulary of specialty terms
- For GP content, standard models perform exceptionally well without customization

### 4. Post-Processing Strategies
- For English transcripts: Apply rule-based post-processing to correct common medical term errors
- For French transcripts: Apply content-based speaker separation for improved dialogue structure

## Technical Architecture

Our transcription system is built with a language-specific approach that utilizes different services based on the detected language:

### Language-Specific Processing

1. **English Transcription Pipeline**:
   - Uses Azure Speech Services with native diarization
   - Configures speech recognition language to "en-US"
   - Enables diarization for conversation transcription
   - Processes speaker roles directly from API response
   - Achieves 78-88% native speaker identification accuracy

2. **French Transcription Pipeline**:
   - Uses Deepgram Nova-2 model with diarization
   - Configures API with `model=nova-2&diarize=true&language=fr&punctuate=true&utterances=true`
   - Primary approach: Uses utterance-level diarization
   - Fallback approach: Uses word-level diarization when utterances aren't available
   - Implements content-based speaker separation for improved role identification
   - Raw API speaker identification accuracy: 5-10% (requires post-processing)

### Audio Processing

For both pipelines, the system:
1. Verifies audio format and quality
2. Converts to 16kHz mono WAV if necessary
3. Handles audio files of various durations
4. Creates temporary processed files when needed
5. Cleans up temporary files after processing

### Speaker Identification Approach

The French transcription pipeline implements a sophisticated content-based approach to compensate for Deepgram's limited native speaker identification:

1. **Utterance Analysis**:
   - Extracts all utterances with speaker information
   - Maps speaker IDs to doctor/patient roles
   - Merges consecutive utterances from the same speaker

2. **Word-level Processing** (Fallback):
   - When utterance information is unavailable, falls back to word-level diarization
   - Tracks speaker changes at the word level
   - Reconstructs segments based on speaker transitions

3. **Content-based Enhancement**:
   - Analyzes content to identify question/answer patterns
   - Detects introductions, medical explanations, and symptom reports
   - Assigns roles based on linguistic patterns typical of doctor-patient interactions

This architecture ensures optimal processing for each language while maintaining consistent output format, enabling comparative evaluation and unified downstream processing.

Our evaluation followed a robust scientific approach to ensure reliable and reproducible results:

### Data Collection and Preparation

1. **Dataset Creation**:
   - Generated realistic medical conversations for both cardiology and general practice
   - Created paired consultation and follow-up dialogues for consistent evaluation
   - Annotated speaker roles (doctor/patient) and medical terminology
   - Translated content to ensure equivalent terminology complexity in both languages

2. **Audio Generation**:
   - Converted text to speech using professional TTS services
   - Applied consistent voice profiles for doctor and patient roles
   - Generated three noise condition variants: clean, semi-noise, and full noise
   - Standardized audio format (16kHz, mono, WAV) for consistent processing

3. **Processing Pipeline**:
   - Implemented identical pre-processing for all models
   - Processed audio through multiple API configurations (Deepgram and Azure)
   - Stored raw API responses for detailed analysis
   - Applied consistent post-processing for comparison

### Evaluation Methodology

## Conclusion

Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that a dual-model approach using Deepgram's Nova-3-medical for English and Nova-2 for French content provides the optimal balance of medical term accuracy, speaker identification, and resilience to varying audio conditions. While Azure Speech Services provides adequate performance, it consistently lags behind the specialized Deepgram models, particularly for medical terminology and speaker diarization.

The Deepgram configuration is recommended for all medical transcription needs in a bilingual Canadian healthcare context, with Azure serving as a viable fallback option when needed.
