good morning how have you been since our last visit hi doctor i've been a bit better but i still have some symptoms can you tell me more about these symptoms have they improved worsened or stayed the same the sneezing and runny nose have improved a bit but the itchy and watery eyes are about the same have you been taking the prescribed antistinants nasal spray and eye drops regularly yes i've been using them as instructed have you noticed any side effects from these medications no i haven't had any side effects good to hear let's proceed with a physical examination thank you for your patience your nasal passage looks less swollen which suggests the treatment is working i would recommend a stronger allergy eye drop okay thank you doctor great did you get a chance to think about getting the flu shot
