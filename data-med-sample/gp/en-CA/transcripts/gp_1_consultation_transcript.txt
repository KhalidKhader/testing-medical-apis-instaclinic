good morning what brings you in today hello doctor i've been feeling uncomfortable lately i've noticed that i have to urinate more frequently than usual and is quite painful each time also the urine seems to be cloudy and has a strong odor i'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well any other symptoms you've noticed yes i've also been feeling feverish and i've been experiencing lower abdominal pain how long have you been experiencing these symptoms about days now alright do you have any allergies no not that i am aware of oak let me conduct a physical exam and then we'll take a urine sample for testing your vitals are stable but the lower abdomen seems tender we'll need to send you a urine sample for testing to confirm but your symptoms suggest a urinary tract infection oh no is it serious doctor it's quite common especially in women it's usually caused by bacteria entering the urinary tract if left untreated it can lead to more serious complications but with early treatment you should be fine i'll prescribe an antibiotic called nitrofurantoin which should help clear the infection it's important to finish the whole course of antibiotics even if you start feeling better okay i understand also drink plenty of water to help flush out bacteria avoid coffee alcohol and spicy foods as they can irritate your bladder
