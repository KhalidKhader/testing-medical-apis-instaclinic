# SOAP Note

**SUBJECTIVE**
The patient reports feeling somewhat better since the last visit, but still experiencing occasional rapid heartbeat episodes. They report these episodes to be less frequent, with no change in duration but less intensity than before. The patient has been taking the prescribed aspirin regime for their blood pressure without any noticed side effects.

**OBJECTIVE**
Physical examination shows the patient's blood pressure is manic, indicating an improvement from the previous visit. Heart rate is still slightly elevated (phendom). Test results received show abnormal heart rhythms on the EKG and changes in heart muscle from the echocardiogram.

**ASSESSMENT**
Based on the reported symptoms, examination findings, and test results, the patient is diagnosed with ventricular tachycardia.

**PLAN**
The treatment plan includes starting the patient on a medication called Metoprolol, a type of beta blocker that can help control heart rate. The patient is to continue with their current aspirin regime for their blood pressure. The patient should continue to monitor their symptoms and report any changes. A follow-up visit will be scheduled to monitor the patient's response to the new medication.
