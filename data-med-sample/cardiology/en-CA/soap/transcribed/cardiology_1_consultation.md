# SOAP Note

## Subjective: 
The patient has recently been experiencing episodes of rapid heartbeat, especially at rest in the evenings, lasting for a few minutes at a time. During these episodes, the patient feels dizzy, short of breath, and has palpitations; once nearly fainting. No chest pain, sweating, or leg swelling has been reported. The patient takes daily Aspirin for blood pressure management and has a known allergy to Penicillin. The patient's family physician has suggested the possibility of ventricular tachycardia.

## Objective:
The patient's blood pressure and heart rate are slightly elevated. No immediate signs of distress are evident during the consultation. Further tests including an EKG, echocardiogram, and possibly a stress test have been planned.

## Assessment:
The patient's symptoms and slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate suggest the possibility of ventricular tachycardia. However, a definitive diagnosis will need to be confirmed by further testing.

## Plan:
Pending confirmation of the diagnosis, potential treatment options include medication management, lifestyle modifications, and possibly catheter ablation. The patient will undergo further tests first to establish a diagnosis before proceeding with a detailed treatment plan.
