good morning i'm doctor i tell your cardiologist how have you been feeling since our last meeting morning doctor i've been doing okay but i'm still feeling a bit tired i see has there been any change in your chest discomfort it's still there when i exert myself but it feels a bit less intense than before that's encouraging have you been able to stick to the medication regimen we discussed yes i've been taking the azole the beta blocker and the statin as you directed but i've noticed i feel a bit dizzy sometimes after taking the beta blocker dizziness can be a side effect of beta blockers especially when standing up quickly i recommend you stand up slowly and sit down if you feel dizzy if it continues or worsens we may need to adjust the dosage any other side effects no that's about it your heart rate and blood pressure are improving there's still some slight elevation but it's a positive trend i've also received your test results the egg and echocardiogram show some damage from a heart attack but the stress test results are encouraging based on your progress and test results i believe the current treatment is effective however we'll keep monitoring your symptoms and adjust the treatment as needed what's the next step doctor i understand thank you doctor
