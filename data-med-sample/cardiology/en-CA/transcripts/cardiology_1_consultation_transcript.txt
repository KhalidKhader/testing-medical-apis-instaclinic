Good morning, missus Smith. How are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. I've been better, I suppose. I've been feeling my heart race quite a bit lately, and it's making me feel a bit dizzy and weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about it in detail. When did you first notice these symptoms? I suppose it started a few weeks ago, but it's been getting worse. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fainting spells? No chest pain, but I do feel winded quite easily. Have you noticed any triggers or patterns? For example, does the racing heart happen after you've exerted yourself? Not necessarily. It seems to come on quite randomly. I see. I'd like to run a few tests including an egg and possibly an echocardiogram to check your heart's rhythm and to see how it's pumping blood. We may also do a stress test if needed. Alright, doctor. After examination. Your heart rate is indeed a bit elevated and irregular. You have ventricular tachycardia, missus Smith. It's a condition where the lower chambers of your heart beat too fast, causing inefficient blood flow. Oh, that sounds serious. What can we do about it? We have some effective treatment options, including medications to control your heart rhythm and possibly a procedure called catheter ablation if necessary. Lifestyle changes, like reducing caffeine and alcohol, could also help. I see. And what's the next step, doctor? Thank you, doctor. I'll follow your recommendations.
